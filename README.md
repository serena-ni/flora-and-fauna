# 🌿 flora & fauna

**flora & fauna** is a small, browser-based ecosystem simulation game built with html, css, and vanilla javascript. you manage a simple ecosystem of plants, herbivores, and predators, trying to keep everything in balance as the system evolves over time.

this project was built for [hack club flavortown](https://flavortown.hackclub.com/) as a personal coding project focused on systems, logic, and visual simulation, with no external frameworks or game engines required.

### 🎮 gameplay

you control the ecosystem turn by turn by choosing one action each round:

- plant seeds → increase plant population (also helps herbivores)
- add herbivores
- add predators
- skip turn

after each turn:
- plants grow naturally
- herbivores eat plants
- predators eat herbivores
- populations reproduce
- random events (droughts, disease, migration) may occur

your goal is to keep the ecosystem stable for as many turns as possible.
